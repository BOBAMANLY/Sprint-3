# Overview
I decided to write this code in the Kotlin programming language. It seemed to be a good idea to learn and understand the basic syntax of the language and its components.

This program is object oriented and uses classes and data structures to calculate parts of a loan.

I wanted to write this code to make a useful application for calcilating parts of a loan. I didn't like how loan calulators online needed you to know the values for each part of the loan to calculate your monthly payment, so I wrote a program that could calculate the interest rate you need in order to have the monthly payment you want.

# Development Environment

Kotlin was the language used. No external libraries needed to be imported

# Useful Websites

* [W3Schools (Classes)](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/kotlin_classes.php)
* [W3Schools (When statements)](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/kotlin_when.php)

# Future Work

* Implement the function to solve for the interest rate
* Implement the function to solve for the number of payments
* Create a GUI
